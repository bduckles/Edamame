One challenge I would expect to face is that there is may not be a good reference database to align sequences to. ,"I would try a shotgun sequencing approach, where I would focus on gene regions that would help distinguish OTUs down to species level (@ 98% similarity). I would create Bray-Curtis distance matrices to first look at how similar the communities are to one another using a mantel test.

I believe soil microbes are relatively well-known so I would expect a good sensitivity and specificity to taxonomic and functional sequence identification. However, I'm not sure if that would be enough to recognize differences between bacteria from both plots, so maybe a shotgun metagenomics would be a better approach. The limitations of the analysis are that they are just descriptive, there are no predictions and only evaluating diversity and composition, for example, will not say anything about functionality.

The challenges would likely involve undescribed bacteria that are only seen in this worm, and potentially free-living bacteria that are incidental in the gut of this worm (depending on what its ""specialized diet"" is composed of).  This latter challenge may require a reference based OTU analysis, as de novo assignment would be inappropriate if free-living and symbiotic bacteria cannot be separated from the sequence data set.  As such, a quality reference data base would have to be obtained (possibly Green Genes, or Silva).","You would have to find away to assemble the genomes of different organisms, or to pull out specific reference gene regions from all genomes (like a region of the 16S gene).  The second approach would likely require very high depth of read to be effective.Once assemblies, or OTUs (based on reference region) were established differences could be essayed using alpha diversity metrics, or something like Bray-Curtis to measure comparative diversity.

Although sequences lengths are shorter compared to 454-pyrosequencing it can produce more reads resulting in higher coverage. Resources that would help with analysis  would be reference genomes.,"Sequences could be grouped according to composition of the sequence (e.g. G+C content) or by similarity to a reference genome.

",Answer,Answer,Learn as much as I can about metagenomic analysis! ,LearnMore,21,"Since it is a 16S marker analysis I would use Illumina sequencing in order to get sufficient depth.  Ideally I would like to have a similar worm that does not have this specialized diet to use as a comparative and I would look for community members that were different between the two (analyzed in either QIIME or mothur).  This search could be more informed by understanding the microbes that generally carry genes for the metabolic pathway in question (if known).  A major challenge would be that the strains carrying this pathways may have acquired them recently and therefore not be phylogenetically distinct.  Also, it may be a very small segment of the population that performs this highly specialized pathway and this would not be visible in the 16S analysis. ",For this analysis I would look at abundance of different functional groups as well as overall phylogenetic diversity.  I would expect very low sensitivity in the phylogenetic analysis since the 16S data is only a small portion of the overall sequencing effort.  For the functional analysis I would likely begin with the MG-RAST breakdown of functions and look for particular sub-groups that were different between the two sites. ,Answer,Answer,,NoAnswer,22,"-I believe there is a set of 'universal' primers that are used in the literature for amplification of diverse 16S sequences.

","Could analyze by comparing the data to a known dataset and blasting against it, but then you would have limitations of only knowing what was already known in the dataset. Or you may have limitations because of PCR biases in your sequencing preparation techniques, in which only a portion of the microbial community is amplified correctly, and the rare members become lost in translation. ",Answer,Answer,Hoping to get a baseline level of information about pertinent topics in bioinformatics for my research purposes in order to proceed with my doctoral research.,BasicUnd,24,"In terms of the sequencing strategy, it is important to consider the depth of coverage required to characterize the gut community of the non-model worm as well as a specific hypothesis you might have about how the communities between the model and non-model worm may differ. Specifically, think about if you need to consider rare microbes. In terms of challenges, since this is a non-model worm, you might want to also sequence the gut community of a model worm on the same specialized diet. I'm not sure what other resources you would need to do this other than information for comparing the model worm gut community and organisms typically found in worms (i.e., using BLAST).",I would start by identifying a hypothesis of how the corn vs pasture communities will differ. Then you can consider the depth you are interested in because soil communities are so diverse this is important. I would then try to assemble reads and try to pull out specific members or genes identified in the hypothesis. Technical limitations may include it being difficult to look for uncommon functional genes or organisms that are not characterized in typically used databases (i.e. BLAST).,Answer,Answer,I'm hoping to come out of here with a basic understanding of metagenomic sequencing tools so I can analyze data on my own and know where to look when I get stuck.,BasicUnd,25,"The first step would be to identify the number of replicate worms needed to get the sample size needed for statistical power (might require 9-10 animals) to account for variability.  Then determining which 16S variable region (or regions) would be ideal for identifying the microbiota in the worm gut.  Then, then sequencing depth needed to capture the amount of diversity present.  Challenges might be obtaining enough or clean enough bacterial DNA (without host carryover) for good amplification and sequencing.  Depending on what the microbiota are that are present, another issue might be classifying the sequences based on a reference database.  One resource might be constructing a custom database for classifying.  Other resources needed are a way to analyze the raw sequences (QIIME or mothur), enough RAM and processors to run analyses, statistical, and visualization programs.  ","In this case, you would be comparing two treatment types on the soil, one with corn and the other dairy cow pasture.  Replicate soil samples from each type would be required to obtain statistical power and account for variability. Considering that metagenomic sequencing is much more intensive in terms of sequencing depth needed and data obtained, it might only be practical to get duplicate samples from each soil type.  Especially since soil is high in bacterial (and eukaryotic and viral) diversity, this type of study would require deeper sequencing than amplicon based sequencing.  The sensitivity will depend on the sequencing depth used and the specificity to taxonomic and functional sequence identification will depend on the methods used for metagenomic analysis.  i.e. how is assembly performed (how long the contigs/scaffolds are) and how well they match to existing databases.  The technical limitations will be that the data generated for metagenomic analyses are much greater and it will take much more computing power to process them.  ",Answer,Answer,"Specifically, I am really interested in learning how to statistically analyze my sequencing data sets and using R to visualize my dataset.  Overall, I'm hoping to come away from this workshop with a deep understanding of both front to end amplicon and metagenomic analysis that I can readily adapt in my own research and for publications. I expect to overcome many of the computational and statistical issues that I am currently encountering in the sequence analyses and have a feeling that I know exactly what I'm doing and the methods that I'm using are correct!
