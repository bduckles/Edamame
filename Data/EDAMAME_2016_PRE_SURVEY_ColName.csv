",For this analysis I would look at abundance of different functional groups as well as overall phylogenetic diversity.  I would expect very low sensitivity in the phylogenetic analysis since the 16S data is only a small portion of the overall sequencing effort.  For the functional analysis I would likely begin with the MG-RAST breakdown of functions and look for particular sub-groups that were different between the two sites. ,39,Ph.D.-holding Professional,Female,Caucasian/White,,romk902016/07/11 8:30:32 AM EST,Intermediate Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,Low Ability,No Ability,No Ability,Strongly Agree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Comfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,"-I believe there is a set of 'universal' primers that are used in the literature for amplification of diverse 16S sequences.

Specifically, think about if you need to consider rare microbes. In terms of challenges, since this is a non-model worm, you might want to also sequence the gut community of a model worm on the same specialized diet. I'm not sure what other resources you would need to do this other than information for comparing the model worm gut community and organisms typically found in worms (i.e., using BLAST).",I would start by identifying a hypothesis of how the corn vs pasture communities will differ. Then you can consider the depth you are interested in because soil communities are so diverse this is important. I would then try to assemble reads and try to pull out specific members or genes identified in the hypothesis. Technical limitations may include it being difficult to look for uncommon functional genes or organisms that are not characterized in typically used databases (i.e. BLAST).,30,Graduate Student,Female,Caucasian/White,I'm hoping to come out of here with a basic understanding of metagenomic sequencing tools so I can analyze data on my own and know where to look when I get stuck.,64732016/07/11 8:34:13 AM EST,Intermediate Ability,Intermediate Ability,No Ability,Low Ability,Intermediate Ability,Low Ability,Low Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,Low Ability,Low Ability,No Ability,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Comfortable,I do not know what this is.,Uncomfortable,Comfortable,Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,I do not know what this is.,"The first step would be to identify the number of replicate worms needed to get the sample size needed for statistical power (might require 9-10 animals) to account for variability.  Then determining which 16S variable region (or regions) would be ideal for identifying the microbiota in the worm gut.  Then, then sequencing depth needed to capture the amount of diversity present.  Challenges might be obtaining enough or clean enough bacterial DNA (without host carryover) for good amplification and sequencing.  Depending on what the microbiota are that are present, another issue might be classifying the sequences based on a reference database.  One resource might be constructing a custom database for classifying.  Other resources needed are a way to analyze the raw sequences (QIIME or mothur), enough RAM and processors to run analyses, statistical, and visualization programs.  ","In this case, you would be comparing two treatment types on the soil, one with corn and the other dairy cow pasture.  Replicate soil samples from each type would be required to obtain statistical power and account for variability. Considering that metagenomic sequencing is much more intensive in terms of sequencing depth needed and data obtained, it might only be practical to get duplicate samples from each soil type.  Especially since soil is high in bacterial (and eukaryotic and viral) diversity, this type of study would require deeper sequencing than amplicon based sequencing.  The sensitivity will depend on the sequencing depth used and the specificity to taxonomic and functional sequence identification will depend on the methods used for metagenomic analysis.  i.e. how is assembly performed (how long the contigs/scaffolds are) and how well they match to existing databases.  The technical limitations will be that the data generated for metagenomic analyses are much greater and it will take much more computing power to process them.
