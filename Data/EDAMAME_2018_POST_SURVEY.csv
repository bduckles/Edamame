I would also use mothur to annotate against the SILVA databases. After the workshop, I still expect to face some challenges but many fewer. For example, I am not 100% sure how to build my own EC2 instance, but I feel comfortable enough that I can figure it out. I also am sure there will be some challenges along the pipeline with errors in executing commands, etc, but I feel comfortable enough to troubleshoot those. In terms of additional resources, I feel comfortable that I have access to everything (EC2, mothur, R). The only additional resources I would seek may be advice from other scientists.","Using the raw reads from each site, I would use an EC2 instance to download the several packages we learned about (such as Trimmomatic, etc) and begin by trimming the raw reads to remove both the adaptors and low quality reads. Then I would assemble the trimmed reads (both F and R) into contigs using megahit. Then I would map the raw reads to the contigs to make hit counts using bowtie2.  After this, there are two options, depdending on if I were interested in reconstructing large contigs or if I were more interested in total hits to particular genes. I usually am interested in the latter. Therefore, I would use gene calling to get hits to particular ORFs. I would do this with HTSeq by comparing to MGRAST for the gene annotation ORFs.
I understand now the limitations of this analysis. The ability to reconstruct a metagenome greatly depends on the sequencing depth and diversity of the sample. While MiSeq can be used to detect 10s of 1000s of OTUs, due to the greater size of a genome compared to the 16S gene, you can really only cover a limited subset of genome-equivalents. This gets even harder if the community is very diverse, as the coverage per genome will be reduced. I feel comfortable making these calculations for a particular environment based on the sequencing depth (HiSeq is probably better) and the expected diversity of the community.","Very good","Very good","Very good","Adequate","Very good","Very good","Very good","Good","Good","Good","Very good","Very good","Very well","Yes","Yes","Thank you!

I would keep A copy of the raw data fastq file would be used for multiple platforms: I would use mothur as one platform to assemble OTUs, and then also use QIIME as another platform to assemble OTUs. Some issues to consider with these two platforms is that OTU clustering is based on 97% similarity, so it's possible that actually different organisms could OTUs be clustered together. To mediate this some, I would also use the Usearch pipeline and ZOTUs to create amplicon sequence variants that are based off of 100% similarity. I would then compare the two OTU assemblies and the ASV and look for discrepancies between the two outputs. ","One approach to understand how the functional gene potential varies between the two farm soils is to assemble and annotate the metagenomes using BLAST, and another approach for metaG assembly and annotation would be to use MG-RAST. Issues to troubleshoot on both of these platforms is to make sure the adapters were accurately trimmed. It's possible that one of the paired ends may be lost during trimming of the adapters. Also need to make sure the quality score for the alignment is good.

The problem is, you maybe get a lot of eukaryotic DNA contamination. Thus, you might have to use more specific marker/primer. Second problem that you might be faced is the limitation of references resulted in low resolution of the taxonomy of your data. To explore the data set, you need to understand what is the questions or purposes of your experiment. Thus, you may have to try different set of statistical approaches on R. Besides, you may also try to build your own references/databases of gut microbial community with   
other researchers from the same field in order to get better/higher resolution of your taxonomic analysis.","the experiment is very interesting because you have two very different two sites. Taxonomic and functional analyses can be done by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA sequencing. But, since 16S rRNA gene is too conserved sometimes it makes difficult to distinguish the communities, thus you may want to use rplB gene or other specific gene. You might want to see the differences between those sites by comparing the alpha and beta diversity of the two data. Then you will want to know who are the big players of the communities there by analyzing the most abundant taxa. It is also important to determine the core microbiome between those two sites because since the samples come from single farm, you might want to see shared microbial taxa.","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very well","Yes","Yes","I think it is important for the instructor to follow the tutorial otherwise we will get confuse.

I would expect the diversity to be lower compared to soil environments for example, so we could expect a higher coverage for each representative. It will largely depend on the research questions, but guts are quite stable environments. If you want to find changes in community composition one needs to design experiments including stressors or different diets. If the question is the function of the microbial community in the digestion of the specialised diet, 16S rRNA probably will not give much of a better insight. Another issue could be, as the system you study is very specific that the annotation of taxa and their classification might be difficult as databases may lack those taxa. Again, it will depend on your research question but combining 16S rRNA with metagenomics or transcriptomics could be more insightful for their functions.","A general issue of soil samples will be that diversity is so high that you might end up with a very low coverage of reads. Meaning that one potentially will only be able to sequence the most abundant representatives in both plot types. If the research question is to see community composition differences, total DNA (metagenomics) will reduce the amount of information but 16S rRNA would be a better approach. If the aim is also to investigate the functional potential, the approach to increase specificity is to do an assembly based annotation. It will allow you to assemble longer contigs on which you can map the reads. One has to be aware though that you will loose a lot of information and probably will only be able to investigate the most abundant organisms in both soil types. On the other hand, if one is interested in the number of functions one should do a raw read based annotation with the mind-set that one can have mis-annotations due to too short reads.","Very good","Very good","Adequate","Good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very good","Very well","Yes","Yes","I really enjoyed the office hours where we could discuss about specific approaches. I wish I would have been further in my project to have more specific questions to discuss but it was already very insightful to hear about other peoples problems and research questions. I also liked that you invited speakers to talk about their research so we can see the approaches being applied. But I think it would have been helpful if you could have added examples of experimental or field studies in the presentations before we start learning about the workflow. We had several questions about when to use what approach and then often the answer was ""it will depend on your questions, what is your question?"". But I think you could give a broad overview of what kind of questions you can ask by using which method. We covered this by talking about everyone's specific problems but I have the impression that the answer was less clear than it could have been.
Something else that came into my mind was, when we talked about how people were selected to come to the workshop. I had the impression that people who already have a dataset were preferred over people without one. However, I think this workshop is also very helpful for students in their early stages, too, to prevent all the potential sequencing mistakes that one can fall into to maximise their data quality because that's what enables us to do a better or more confident data analysis.
Otherwise, even if the course was very intensive and exhausting, I learned a lot and more than I expected. I was amazed by the TAs support and the generous financial support we got to cover the accomodation and food. Thank you!","neko"

I would do the same with either a related model worm as a control/comparison, or would look for a closely related worm that does have this specific diet. I would prepare multiple replicates, expecting subtle differences in data. 

I would quality asses, normalize, and trim the sequence data, then cluster the reads into OTUs using mothur. A non model worm with a unique digestive tract and diet may harbor microbes that are not well represented in databases of known or cultured organisms, so I would likely have to cluster the sequences de novo before identifying them taxonomically. 

I would use R to calculate the similarity matrix to compare the communities of the different worms . I would then create an ordination and do some hypothesis testing to determine whether the communities are different (either between worms or within worms eating a different diet) ","Soil is highly diverse and contains many microbial taxa, so I would sequence as deeply as possible, while using multiple replicate extractions from each site.  I would start analysis by QC-ing the data, then assemble the sequences into contigs. I would begin analysis by looking at community membership - either by 16S or functional gene sequences to get an idea of whether membership changes by site, but this analysis is limited due to the conserved nature of the 16S gene. 

I would start by looking for functional genes that show significant changes in abundance between sites, along with looking for correlating changes in metadata (soil chemistry, features, etc). I would use that information to generate hypotheses on which functions or microbes may be important in processes important to each site.

Others were more rote copy/paste tutorials and did not discuss *why* we would choose a particular st of parameters or packages, or what  is the goal, function, or output of a given set of commands. I found this to be the case for the mothur tutorial in particular, and to some degree also with the metagenome analysis tutorials. 

I would have appreciated more discussion on how to adapt these workflows to different questions or datasets, with some specific examples.

The manual ordination exercise was really helpful in emphasizing the process behind the calculations. ","543923"

However, since this worm has a unique digestive tract and specialized diet, it is likely that the organisms in it's gut are not well characterized. In this case, I think it would be particularly useful to consider the diet of the organisms specifically (i.e. what microbes may be entering its gut), the specific conditions of the gut (e.g. pH), and the community from a better characterized/model worm.","I'd want to have high replication of field samples from each plot type for 16S amplicon sequencing that are spatially dispersed within the site in order to capture as much of the heterogeneity within the plot as possible. I would also want to sample for metagenomes, but because of amount of data, I would need to limit these samples to perhaps 2 per plot type. Together, these two datasets would allow me to explore ""dominant"" community structure (16S) and examine a more less biased, more functionally informative set of data (metagenomes). The 16S samples will provide a phylogenetically coarser view, but spatially resolved view of the site, while the metagenomes will provide a higher resolution view of potential differences in community composition and function between the two sites.

Like in office hours, which I really appreciated. Something like: Day 1: all the eramame-rs who has brough their own data and want o work on it should come to the office hour to hold a ""pre analysis"" of the data with the TA's. Talk a little bit about the projects, questions and hipotesis of the study. I known that this can be challenging, but in my point of view it would be like perfect. Those who doesn't have their own data could get some from the TAs (as a small sub project) and follow up in the course with these. So, for every tool learned the instructor may present it wth their own data, but use it with each ones data. Like since the begining... ""The day my data arrived"".

Another idea. Once I read a paper about endphytic bacterial diversity in the rainforest, where all the data was collected and partially analysed by studands of a summer discipline. Professors and students published the article together.
One very important point for me that helps a lot in undertanding and using with confidence all the tools presented, is to get familiar, get involved and know about the data, then being much more curious about the result. Like ""fighting"" for it.

Anyway, just an idea.

CONGRATULATIONS TO ASHLEY, ADINA AND ALL THE TA'S. Even though I'm not confortable with all the tools, after the course I feel I CAN DO IT! Many thanks for the opportinity.","I forgot it! :\"
