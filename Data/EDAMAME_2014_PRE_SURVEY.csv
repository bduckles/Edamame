In addition, it may be difficult to assign taxonomy to the microbes if they are not similar to previously studied and sequenced microbes.","I would use the QIIME workflow to separate the sequences based on the plot they came from, eliminate chimeras, assign taxonomy and visualize phylogeny. I would expect this to be relatively sensitive and specific with respect to taxonomic and functional sequence identification but not perfect. A technical limitation of this analysis is that it only assigns OTUs based on percent sequence identity which is not always the best way to classify microbes.",23,Graduate Student,Female,Caucasian/White,,cusacksi@msu.edu,Low Ability,No Ability,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree8/13/2014 9:31:54,Intermediate Ability,Low Ability,Low Ability,High Ability,No Ability,High Ability,Intermediate Ability,Intermediate Ability,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,"If any microbes are known, I would make mock communities and try primer sets on those to reveal any major biases. The community of a specialized worm is not expected to be very diverse. Therefore, I will use a primer set for a wide region of 16s because there is a low chance of misclassifying OTUs. I would also have the freedom to use many replicate worms in different conditions because coverage of many multiplexed samples would not be a problem.","Phylogenetic analysis of shotgun data suffers from low coverage. This may be a problem for more diverse microbial communities, such as a cow pasture (I think).
