","If by ""total DNA sequencing,"" you mean whole genome sequencing, this study could possibly involve the surveying of functional genes/functional groups in the different soil types to look for differences in ecological function.  With these types of studies, getting a suite of chemical metadata on the soil, such as metals, DOC, anions and cations, can pair nicely with the metagenomic data.  This would allow a stronger link between seeing functional groups and the related chemistry (such as the nitrogen cycle).  The sensitivity can be better established with replicates, since soil metagenomes can be highly variable, as well as at varying timepoints/weather conditions.  Specificity depends strong on what genes are profiled, since some genes are better at determining phylogeny than others.

Also the DNA extraction method is important since the amplicons obtained will depend on the quality of DNA and reduced/no presence of contaminants.  The next step will be the selection of the region of 16S to be amplified and length of this region.  This is important for the sequencing method used, including the length of the amplicons and quality of the sequences obtained, so an amplicon of around 300 bp should be fine for identifying the gut microbiome.  Also the selection of the region will influence our ability to determine the existing microflora since the region is going to determine the ""taxonomic"" resolution that we can use to assign the different OTUs and also the biases from the method.  Therefore, based on this I will select an amplicon size of ~300 bp to use MiSeq or HiSeq with 2X250 bp, to have a good overlap when assembling the amplicons.Once the raw data is back, quality filtering and assembly are required, and there are different options for these analyses.  Then, a good database is required to proceed with the analysis.  Different databases will provide different answers, since your analysis depends on the database being used.  Usually for bacteria the best sources are greengenes or SILVA, which are curated databases for these analyses.  In most cases, NCBI (genebank or similar) are not best resource since miss-annotation and unclassified sequences are the most abundant.Using a particular a database different pipelines can be used to analyze the data, and then generate an OTU table that can be used for statistical analyses in R. ","The sequences will be assembled and quality trimmed.  Then, cluster the sequences to reduce redundancy and make the dataset manageable.  The sequnces left will be subjected to chimera analysis to reduce the chance of rare OTUs that introduce noise to the analysis.  After that, sequences will be analyzed against a curated set of sequences to assign taxonomic ranks to the different OTUs identified.  The reliability of the taxonomic ranks depends on the target region, but most cases family level is accurately assigned to OTUs, and in some cases even genera can be done from an assigned.  Once the OTUS have identified or assigned, using the stats and rarefaction, samples are subsampled to the same level to proceed with the actual analysis.One last thing sirloin the sequence analysis is using the database to identify  ""contaminant"" sequences such as chloroplast or mitochondrial 16s like sequences, that can confound the analysis and other contaminants that could be present. This is also related with sensitivity since they are going to affect the recovery of more or certain species, also since we are not amplifying a target region the sensitivity is going to be lower, especially for this rare species.  Since we are doing total DNA, the database is key to construct those genes to recover the taxonomy present in the sample.   The same is true for the functional analysis, thus the lack of annotation of genes or the reduced knowledge of bacterial/eukaryotic genomes are going to affect the assignment of function to Vegas found in th free samples.   Nonetheless, this has improved recently with dedicated databases to improve the assignment of these functional genes.With respect to the functional analysis, it is also important to mention that not all the genes or fragments of DNA sequenced will an active cell or live cell, therefore we have to acknowledge this limitation inherent to the method.The initial approach is to start comparing the abundance and richness of species between corn and pasture plot, however we are limited by locations since this study is conducted in a single location. Then focus on the overall functional assignment to determine if there are specific categories that drive the differences, and the focus on those are different or that  I am interested in such as those related to nitrogen cycling.  Also, correlate the differences in functional categories with the taxonomy assignment to determine trends of functions with certain species.",31,Graduate Student,Male,Latino(a),,rojasfle@msu.edu,Very Comfortable,Comfortable,Uncomfortable,Very Comfortable,Comfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Comfortable,Comfortable,Comfortable6/22/15 8:10,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,Intermediate Ability,No Ability,,Low Ability,No Ability,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,,,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,":-(  :-( :-(I wish I know....",":-(  :-( :-(I wish I know....",28,Graduate Student,Male,Asian/Asian American,"I hope I will be able to circle more ""YES"" when I finish this workshop if I have the chance to take the same survey again.",100liangdi@gmail.com,I do not know what this is.,Uncomfortable,I do not know what this is.,I do not know what this is.,I do not know what this is.,Uncomfortable,I do not know what this is.,I do not know what this is.,I do not know what this is.,Very Uncomfortable,Very Uncomfortable6/22/15 9:02,Low Ability,No Ability,No Ability,Low Ability,No Ability,No Ability,No Ability,,No Ability,No Ability,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,,,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,,Agree,Strongly Agree,,,29,Graduate Student,Female,Caucasian/White,I'd like to be able to feel good when evaluating generated sequence data from beginning to end and knowing I chose the right programme to do it. ,anne@himmelberg.com,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable6/22/15 9:03,Low Ability,Low Ability,No Ability,Intermediate Ability,Intermediate Ability,High Ability,Intermediate Ability,,No Ability,No Ability,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,,,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Disagree,,Agree,Agree,"Depends on the question I'm interested in.
