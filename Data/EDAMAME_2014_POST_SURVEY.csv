The large number of gut microbes might hamper specificity of the identification from swamping out the rare signals, making assembly difficult. It could be overcome to a degree with digital normalization, but you would not get as much coverage per sequencing run.If gut microbes mostly perish or go dormant (a big assumption), metatranscriptomics may help comparisons due to only active RNA being sequenced, leveling the read depth.",,,,,,,Very Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Good,Adequate,Adequate,Very Good,,,Good,Very Good,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Time needs to be managed better.

Variation between samples from the same worm could prove difficult as well as the amount of microbial DNA that can be extracted from these model worms. A data analysis pipeline such as Mothur or QIIME would be needed in order to go from raw sequencing data to conclusions about the microbial community present in the worm's gut. A mock community would need to be run on the sequencing platform at the same time in order to compensate and be aware of sequencing error.,"First, I would begin by doing an assembly independent method for analyzing the functional and phylogenetic diversity. I expect this would be difficult because the Illumina reads are rather short and can make for a difficult time assigning function/taxonomy. This method is also extremely dependent upon the reference database. If there were several unsequenced microbes present in the sample they would not map well to the database. To overcome this, assembly can be performed. This method is computationally taxing as the amount of memory needed to keep track of reads and compare them is large. In order to overcome this limitation, digital normalization can be used to reduce the excess reads that do not provide any additional information for assembly of a region. Assembly will create larger sequences, allowing for better taxonomic identification. Raw sequences could then be mapped back onto these contigs to get an idea of functional and phylogenetic diversity.",,,,,,,Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Adequate,Adequate,Good,,,Very Good,Very Good,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,"A truly great workshop.

I would need a software like mothur or QIIME to cluster the data and build OTU tables to analyze in R or some other statistics package. Other challenges are choosing which clustering algorithm to use, and how to visualize the data.","I would use digital normalization prior to assembling the shotgun metagenomic data from the communities. This will give a better chance of assembling the low concentration OTUs. Most of the sequencing contigs may be identified by using BLAST or a similar search tool if there are data available, but some contigs may be unidentified.

Also because our organism of interest is a non-model worm, there may be a high number of novel or poorly documented bacterial species present, which may impair our ability to determine the functionality of the community within its gut.  A potential additional resource that may prove to be helpful is the inclusion of a model worm's gut microbe community to use as a reference when exploring our own organisms data set.  Timing of the sample collection would also be very important when designing this experiment, both the age of the worm and what point of a daily cycle would be best for determining which microbes are present in a normal digestive context.
