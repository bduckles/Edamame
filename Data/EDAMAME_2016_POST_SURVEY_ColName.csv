One recommendation that I do have for the tutorials is running through the programs and the scripts first, THEN having us work through the tutorials on our own. I think this would do a better job of giving us an overview of what the program is doing and what it is capable of, rather than focusing on properly copying and pasting the code. Then we would be able to work through it more at our own pace. This is advantageous for those who have seen the programs before, since they can get all the overview at the beginning that they may not fully understand, then go ahead or help others, rather than having to wait at each step to see if there's any new information for them. It would also be helpful for those who have never seen the program to be able to focus just on what the program is doing, and not on completing the code.

problems-  No reference database. ","First, if looking at total DNA from soil samples (focussing on micro-organisms) I would use a suite of primers to amplify both bacterial and fungal dna. For bacteria I would use 16S primers and would amplify the fungal ITS2 region. I would choose these regions because they would offer high resolution at the species taxonomic level. After receiving the sequences back from the core I would process using mother. The Silva database would be used with the bacterial sequences for both alignment and taxonomic identification. The UNITEv6 database will be used for classification and taxonomic identification of the fungal sequences. A Denovo alignment will be used in the fungal pipeline.

I would compare alpha diversity within each of the sites (corn and cow pasture) and then conduct analyses comparing beta diversity between the two sites. 

phylogenomic comparisons would be difficult while amplifying the ITS2 region and would move to the LSU amplification if I wanted to construct phylogenies.

",Good,Good,Very Poor,Adequate,Very Good,Very Good,Poor,Adequate,Good,Good,,No,Somewhat,Yes,No,Yes,No,"I really enjoyed the course. There are two things that stuck out to me that I would recommend.

1) I think for the amplicon analysis people it is really important to have skills in multiple software forms. I was really hoping to have the opportunity to learn both mothur and Qiime. I really didn't like that we had to chose between the two. I am a predominately mothur user, but there are often times when I come to a stop in the road and the advice I get is to run that command or that ""alignment"" (whatever it may be) in Qiime. 
By coming here I was hoping to sharpen my skills in mothur and explore some new options in Qiime. Considering the amplicon analysis was for the most part just one day I felt this really limited how much I was able to grow on this front. 
Perhaps making the amplicon analysis days spread out into two days, one being mothur and the other being a Qiime day, the people interested in amplicon analyses would see and more importantly learn about multiple options. I'm coming out of here as much a Qiime newbie as I was a week ago. Very sad.

2) I thought there would be more focus on discussing experiments and hypothesis testing. There were several times I was asking myself ""what is this useful for? More importantly, what questions can I answer with these tools?"" I think those discussions should be had before each tutorial. I personally need to know what framework I'm working within otherwise things just feel like a black box for me. It wasn't until I talked with a classmate about their questions on the 3rd day of metagenome assembly that I truly understood how these tools are useful. I suppose I felt a bit like the big picture was skimmed over. Without having or understanding guiding questions the rest falls to the wayside.

I would use the de novo OTU picking method in Qiime so I get to pick all the reads in the community. I would explore this method first to find out if the OTUs I am obtaining could be really representing part of the gut community

I guess we would look for interesting members that we could extrapolate may be involved in this unique metabolism, particularly if there is information available on strains that are capable of this type of metabolism.

I presume for a study of soil by shotgun sequencing I would use HiSeq and maximize the depth per sample.  I would then want to assemble the reads, and to do this I would combine the replicates to have greater coverage and then map the reads from each individual replicate to the contigs to see abundance of those genes in each sample.  I could then pull out all the 16S genes in order to compare the taxonomic diversity at each site (comparing alpha and beta diversity using standard metrics) and I could do PCoA analysis on the functional genes to look for differences between the communities.  I feel the taxonomic analysis would be much more limited if it were done this way since you don't get the depth of sequencing that you can get from an amplicon analysis.

We had flash presentations but it would maybe be cool to offer the opportunity for anyone who has their data in more advanced stages (or have completed projects recently) to present their work to the class. Maybe just short, optional 15 min presentations.

-Challenge 1: probably getting a huge number of unidentified OTUs. Since our worm is non-model, there will likely be lots of sequences from species not represented in reference databases.
-Challenge 2: merging paired-end reads is not perfect. There will likely be errors that could over-inflate the number of OTUs in my analysis.
-Challenge 3: identifying species reliably from 16S sequences can be difficult since this locus evolves very slowly.
-Challenge 4: we probably can't learn much about organismal function from 16S sequences, unless we're able to identify the species associated with a given 16S sequence and understand it's function/physiology.

Resources: a reference database would be helpful to try to identify OTUs. 

","Analysis 1) I could use targeted assembly, looking at nitrogen-cycle-specific genes (for example).

Analysis 2) I could use metagenome assembly, looking at ""all"" genes and hopefully being able to properly annotate their functions.

For both analyses: I'm guessing expected sensitivity/specificity to taxonomic and functional sequence identification would be fairly good, because I'm sure many studies have looked at agricultural soil samples and inputted the common species they find into public databases.

Analysis #1 technical limitations: This is probably not super-high-throughput if I want to look at more than a dozen genes or so.

Analysis #2 technical limitations: rare taxa will likely be 'lost' due to lots of reads from super-high abundant taxa. Also, metagenome assembly is not perfect, and neither is binning, so the number of OTUs we come up with may be wrong. Annotation is certainly subject to limitations as well, since many sequences won't match databases, and those that do could be annotated incorrectly if the database isn't curated.",Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,,,Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,,No,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,"I really enjoyed this course overall, and feel much more comfortable using the command line, running scripts, navigating through the terminal, and preparing to do targeted amplicon and metagenomics analyses!  

One thing I particularly liked about the course was the accessibility of the instructors and TAs for questions. I think having such a large number of instructors was extremely helpful and necessary to adequately meet all the questions in a class of 35 students. I am a beginner and had many questions, but every instructor and TA that I spoke to was both patient and knowledgeable.

The QIIME tutorial (and the cartoon workflow drawn up by Ashley) was extremely clear and helpful! I feel armed and ready to go with QIIME. Same with R: I like how we worked through an entire data analysis: from inputting data to visualizing PCoAs. I also liked how we were able to work through the complete R script for the paper currently in prep in Ashley's lab. 

I also really enjoyed when we were assigned ""exercises"": opportunities to apply what we learned in the tutorials, and take it a step further. For example, after we learned the 'head' command, we were challenged to write a script that grabbed the first 10 lines of a file and wrote the output to a new file.  I think more of this would be extremely helpful!

I think one thing that could be removed from the course is the guest seminars (the 8pm seminars). I liked the talks, but I thought we might get a bit more out of the course if we used that time doing more computational tutorials, allowing us to cover a bit more information in the course. An alternative would be to possibly condense the 9 days of the workshop into a day or two fewer by working more in the evenings rather than the 8pm talks.

You would like want to use 6-9 replicates of the worm depending on the variability of the worm gut microbiome (could look at previous studies to see how many replicates were needed).  Then you would need to decide which variable region of the 16S to sequence and what Illumina chemistry to use for library prep (likely 250 PE v2 chemistry of the V4 region is optimal). The challenges will be how much sequencing depth you will need to sample the community and what ecological questions you are asking (will you be treating the worms with different diets, etc.).  Resources are the computing power to analyze, such as the Amazon EC2 cloud instance or your institutional HPC, software tools for analysis (QIIME, mothur) and statistical tools (R).  Data hygiene and a computing workflow (for others to check and reproduce your work) are key!  Overall, you need to check quality with fastqc, merge your reads (pandaseq, usearch, or qiime), if there was not quality filtering step then quality filter in usearch or qiime, and then go on to otu picking/clustering, assigning taxonomy, diversity analyses (within and between sample diversity) and then input these to QIIME.  Make sure samples have even sampling depth before doing the multivariate statistics.  ","For this study, you would want to run as least duplicate or triplicate biological samples for each plot type so you could account for variability.  The first step is to determine what sequencing type you need (Illumina HiSeq) and how many lanes.  An Illumina run is 1Tbp with 8 lanes per run so you will need to decide how many lanes to run.  Considering the diversity of soil you might only want to run 1 or 2 of the samples per lane of HiSeq Illumina.  Next you will need you have a computing resource (enough RAM and processors) to process the data and expect that it will take a while. Also make sure to save the raw data  in a folder that will remain untouched and that there is a backup of the data.  The first step is to trim off the adaptors (trimmomatic), check quality (fastx), digital normalization (using kmers), filtering errors and redundancies, run the assembly (megahit - kmers), evaluate the assembly (quast), then estimating the abundances by mapping the raw reads back to the assembly (bowtie).  The annotation can be done through MG-RAST or Blast or other programs (prodigal, blast contigs to uniref or other database).  The assembly can also be binned to reduce complexity using metabat. The sensitivity will depend on the diversity of your sample and how much sequencing depth you obtained.  The specificity of the analysis depends on the assembly and databases used.  The assembly is a technical limitation depending on how many kmers you use and how conserved different gene regions are.  This can also take a long time to run.
