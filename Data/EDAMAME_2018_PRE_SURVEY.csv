If you can extract the gut microbial community in a sterile way and extract the DNA you could sequence it on an illumina miseq. Because this worm is non-model and the digestive tract is unique there may not be a lot of hits in any database but it'll be good to know that first. You could have the data run through QIIME to get a scope of the community but keep an eye on the amount of unidentified sequences.

I would then match up all this data to the metadata. Using that I would begin to run a PCoA between the samples to see if they actually cluster differently. Supposing that they do I would then perform an ANOVA to understand which of the community members is causing this difference. I would also pull out the community members that are found in both sample sets using the core microbiome subscript in MEGAN. Function I am unfortunately less sure about. There are a few limitations one of course being that without a control plot it would be difficult to say what is just the native community and what is caused by the corn or the cows.

Is this from a single worm? Are we sampling along its length? or does sequencing strategy mean what kind of platform, etc?
I guess, sampling from a living organism (and a small one at that) there would be a big problem with cross-contamination, mitochondrial 16S sequences, etc. There might be a problem with the worms being stressed, or being fed food that is not their special diet, or being kept in differing environmental conditions that might influence their microbiome. There is also worm growth stage maybe (man, I don't know anything about worms). We would want to get gut samples from as many different worms as possible who are eating the specialized diet, maybe also using different conditions for some of the worms such as different temperatures, moisture levels, etc. to help find out what the core components of the gut microbiome are for this special diet and which are subject to change with the special diet. ","A huge technical limitation right off the bat is that the n for each sample is 1. We are basically comparing one sample to another sample; we just have a lot of subsamples to confirm within-sample diversity. This means that we can't make any real statements about the effects of corn plants vs pasture, because there might be something particular to this corn field or dairy farm responsible for any differences between them other than what they've been used for lately. For example, maybe the pasture is pasture because the soil has been historically poorer on that side of the farm.
I would expect a very very large number of functional genes and a large amount of diversity in general even for single sub-samples. And since it is soil, there is probably a large amount of extra-cellular DNA around and a bunch of bacteria/fungi that are dormant/pores. I am not sure of the steps to figure out which functional genes are there (metagenomic binning?) but I might start with some tests looking at between-site and among-site diversity, and looking at taxa and genes most responsible for the differences between the sites using the DESeq2 package in R. If there were nutrient data for the soil I would also try linking that to functional genes.","34","Graduate Student","Female","Caucasian/White","","merpmerp2"

The issue that might  happens is contamination of eukaryotes. The effort that can be done is the primer design must be as specific as possible to detect microbial community in worm gut. The additional resources that might be beneficial are the microbial (bacterial and fungal) references in the databases. It is important if some scientist who work with gut microbiota construct their own databases/references so that the taxonomy assigning of the microbial community of worm's gut can be conducted with high resolution.","The raw sequences can be analyzed using QIIME pipeline. Taxonomy assigning can be done using SILVA databases or UNITE for the fungi with threshold of 97% similarity. But because of the limitation of the microbial references, sometimes it can be difficult to get high resolution of the taxonomy. The data analyses can be conducted to analyze the beta diversity of the two sites to compare the microbial communities dispersion/patterns between the two. because the sample are taken from the single farm, the analysis of core, rare, and shared taxa can be conducted because the two sites might share the taxa.
