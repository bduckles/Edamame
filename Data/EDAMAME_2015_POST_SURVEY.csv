Because of this, it would be good to have a good amount of biological and technical replicates to account of any natural diversity between organisms and between your methods.  The sequencing strategy would be Illumina MiSeq of the V4 region, with either total 250 bp overlaps, or longer single reads without merging (for more sequencing data).  If the worms could live on both the ""specialized"" and a ""general"" diet, it would be good to compare the two gut communities to see if you can pin down unique/more abundant OTUs in the specialized diet.  Some challenges could be that the baseline community is more diverse than expected between replicates, or that there are more ""unknowns"" because this is a non-model organism.  Additional resources could be public datasets from similar organisms.","My approach would be to take multiple soil repliates, distributed across each plot, on multiple times thoughout the year that correspond with each plot type.  For corn this would be when corn was planted, late corn growth, after harvest, and a longer peroid after harvest.  I would use these time points to choose when to sample the cow pasture, with a possible ""winter"" sampling when the cows are primarily in the barn.  I would extract microbial DNA for metagenomes, with biological and technical replicates (since this is metagenomes, I'd make sure to do some cost/benefit since the amount of data can get out of hand quickly).  Since diversity is high in soill, the sensitivity and specificity may not be as high as other lower diversity microbiomes, and we may end up with more ""unknown"" contigs.  Comparing against other agricultural soil metagenomes may help in this endeavor.  ""Binning"" can help identify the unknowns by comparing GC content and other sequence characteristics. Quality filtering and digital normalization will help increase the quality of the metagenomes by taking out errant signals, sequencing errors, and noise.

Ten worms, run in triplicate in parallel, analyzed independently. Novel microbes are likely in this system, I would make sure to OTU pick (open reference) with several databases to ensure that I'm picking up as many microbes as possible. Furthermore, I would be tempted to search public databases for worm-associated gut microbes and to make my own database. A time-consuming but potentially important step. It is likely that databases like greengenes and silva may lack the breadth to include microbes I'm interested in with these worms.  Denovo OTU picking will probably encompass a large portion of my sequences, and it would make sense to make some trees and then try to place the new microbes in a phylogenetic context.

Maybe we can find a method for live staining and then separating those microbes from the others, and then sequence those (stable isotope probing is one method, but you'd only be picking up microbes that took up the probe, which could be a carbon source, but of course, not all microbes use the same carbon source...and you are then selecting a subset of the population rather than getting a comprehensive survey of the entire living/active community). Let's say that I found a way of selecting living/active microbes. I would take those and compare it to the entire community (extracted in the traditional manner...with no pretreatment), and I would want to asses the variability of those communities and the heterogeneity. Is variability within a sample greater than between treatment types? I have found this to be the case before, so I'd be concerned about being able to answer questions about community structure when the variability is so huge. I would hope that my new technique would reduce the variability and help me to partition portions of the community into ""seed bank"" potential and ""currently active"" fractions.

Therefore, the selection will affect my results.  Also the selection of the pipeline for the assembly is also important and different parameters.

The following step will be the digital normalization of the data since we are going to assemble the data using de Bruijn graphs this can turn into a really complicated step since multiple kmers are going to be present at multiple reads.  By reducing the complexity of the data and eliminating “redundancy” or unique data based on coverage, we assure that assembly is going to have better performance improving the analysis results downstream.  Once the data is normalized, we can proceed with assembly since we already filter out some of the redundancy or poor represented reads, for the assembly it will be important to test different parameters in order to improve the final result.By normalizing the data, we are helping the sensitivity of our analysis since less resources are involved into assemble highly redundant genes, therefore genes that could be omitted or not assemble properly now are going to have a better chance to be assemble. This is also related with going to affect the recovery of more or certain genes during the annotation either functional or taxonomical, since we are correcting the data for different issues.  Since we are doing total DNA, the database is key to construct those genes to recover the taxonomy present in the sample.   The same is true for the functional analysis, thus the lack of annotation of genes or the reduced knowledge of bacterial/eukaryotic genomes are going to affect the assignment of function to genes found in the samples.   Nonetheless, this has improved recently with dedicated databases to improve the assignment of these functional genes.With respect to the functional analysis, it is also important to mention that not all the genes or fragments of DNA sequenced will an active cell or live cell, therefore we have to acknowledge this limitation inherent to the method.The initial approach is to start comparing the abundance and richness of species between corn and pasture plot, however we are limited by locations since this study is conducted in a single location. Then focus on the overall functional assignment to determine if there are specific categories that drive the differences, and the focus on those are different or that  I am interested in such as those related to nitrogen cycling.  Also, correlate the differences in functional categories with the taxonomy assignment to determine trends of functions with certain species.In addition, we can use Xander to focus on specific groups of genes that one can be interested, ushc as nitrogen fixation or other biogeochemical cycling related genes that could drive some of the differences between the samples that are being compared.",,,,,,rojasfle@msu.edu,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Very Good,Very Good,,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,"It will really helpful to have the slides after the presentations or even before for note taking, but I know this is hard since everything keeps updating.

However, illumine propose different strategy sequencing (Miseq, Hiseqs/ 2x150 pb, 2x250, and 2x300 pb, and the price),, Miseq generate enough reads to answer to the above question however to choose the length is very hard. I suppose the longer the size of the reads is better will be the determination of the taxonomy, however there is a higher error sequencing risk. At this point, I think I'll choose the 2x250 pb to minimize the error.The extract the DNA is an important steps of my final quality of reads, I'll need to have enough DNA material to the following steps and also to target the whole community but also a good quality of this extract DNA to not affect the quality of my sequencing. The preparation of the library and the sequencing will be done in illumine plateform, so I don't need to worry bout this step ( well I hope so !) Once the sequenced reads are generated, I'll look first the quality score of the reads generated by the illumine platform and by using the fastq analysis to decide or not to make an other sequencing run. The quality score is fantastic yeah ! I can now analyze this reads, well now come for me to decide which kind of software I'm gonna use (mother vs qiime), but of them have benefits and disadvantages, it's very hard to choose between them, If I have a time ( which is often impossible) I'll try both of the pipelines and look at the main differences that I have, but it doesn't really help to know which one to choose, at this point I will need to really understand the algorithems used to merged contigs, pickup OTUs and cluster theses OTUs and see if this will be in adequation or not with my hypothesis or questions. ",I will use metagenomic analysis to compare both functional and phylogenetic diversities between these two types of soils. This method will give me informations about the relative abundance of both genes and taxons in each soils which will help me to characterize deeply the microbial communities in these soils but also this methods will highlight the difference between both microbial communities which will help me to have an approximations about main functional metabolic pathways in these communities however metranscriptomic analysis will be more helpful to approach these pathways.,,,,,,berdjeb@usc.edu,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Very Good,,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,"The EDAMAME worshop is just amazing and awesome, all the informations that got from the tutorials, the talks and different discussion groups are so precious and I'll be able to quickly apply theme in my own data.

After receiving the raw data, I would check the quality of the data and remove any reads that do not pass a quality score of >33. I would then use pandaseq to merge paired-ended reads. I would then take the merged reads through a Qiime pipeline using pynast to pick my OTUs. The major problem here, since it is a unique digestive tract, is that many of the reference OTU databases may not match the representative OTUs from sequencing. I may have to manually curate my own database with hopes of matching potentially novel OTUs. After picking OTUs, I would evaluate my OTU table and see how many OTUs were not classified. I may need to take this through an iterative process, adding more representative OTUs to my curated reference database in order to classify the gut community members. I would then use statistical packages in R (vegan) to explore alpha diversity and maybe repeat the experiment using a temporal approach (feeding specific diet) to then look at beta diversity as function of time. ","From raw sequences, I would quality filter my data and trim barcodes (assuming both plot types were sequenced on the same flow cell to limit bias). Up to this point, technical limitations would include DNA extraction efficiency and sequencing errors. Once filter, I would assemble each of the metagenomes in contigs using MEGAHit. After assembly, I would need to check the quality of my assembly using QUAST. This may require an iterative approach of running multiple MEGAHit scripts to see which parameters work best for my dataset. From there, I could either upload the assembled genomes to MG-RAST (for annotation and taxonomic classification) or annotate my contigs using PROKKA. Once annotated, I could compare annotations from PROKKA and MG-RAST. I could also use R packages to test hypothesis in alpha diversity between both plot types, whether it be on a specific functional gene of interest or taxonomic classification. Like most -omics approaches, the main limitation in making sense of our metagenomes is our lack complete reference databases. Many taxa and genes are currently novel, but, as isolation and functional characterization increases, our reference databases will increase in their information as well, making metagenomics a powerful approach to understand community structure and its ecophysiological properties in a given environment.

It seems as if this took valuable time away from learning! I realize that time is always an issue and it makes it difficult to cover such a large array of material in a short period of time, but there was a bit too much of copy and paste. It made it difficult to intuitively understand why I was doing something. One suggestion would be (e.g. troubleshooting a parameter) to split different parameter arguments between people in the class and cross-compare results. It would help to provide us with how we can use biological insight to evaluate our results rather than just running through a workflow that works.

Next, paired-end sequences would be assembled with PANDAseq and a mapping file would be made to link sample IDs with the metadata. QIIME would then perform the next set of analysis. Alternatively, Mothur could be used instead of QIIME but QIIME allows for more control over workflow.All assembled reads would be combined and QIIME labels would be added. QIIME would then pick OTUs (clustering) using an open reference-based method that matches to a database and then leaves those reads non-matched to the side for de novo analysis. This step is particularly important for this dataset as we expect a number of novel taxa involved in the metabolism of a specialized diet. Next, QIIME subsamples to an even depth using single_rarefraction.py. Within sample diversity can be calculated (alpha) using alpha_diversity py and visualized. In addition, comparative diversity (beta) can be analyzed using beta_diversity.py. Ordination plots and NMDS can also be created but it would be beneficial to convert the OTU table to a boom table to perform statistics and ordination plots on microbial community data. Unfortunately, this will provide little information on functional data. Metagenomics, or better yet, metatranscriptomics would be complementary to assess the genes involved in this unique metabolism. Appropriate biological replicates and samples taken over time should be included to obtain thorough depth and coverage. Including a mock community in the sequence analysis will also help to validate the analysis.","To perform a comparative analysis of two whole genome sequencing soil samples, it is important to begin with several biological replicates to improve the robustness of the study. Additionally, a mock community should be included to validate our analysis throughout. Once the raw sequence data is obtained, statistics on quality can be obtained using fastx-toolkit. This also includes a step for trimming data using a quality score of 30. Next, digital normalization is peformed to remove redundant data and then errors are filtered using python scripts (normalize-by-median.py and filter-abund.py). The reads are then assembled using de Bruin graphs and an iterative process with MEGAHit and summary statistics are examined using QUAST. Next, the assembled data can be uploaded directly to MG-RAST for annotation along with a mapping file (using bowtie2) that indicates coverage. Concurrently, the assembled data can be annotated using Prokka. This provides a number of genes that are found in the metagenomic datasets. These genes of interest and taxa of interest should then be comparatively analyzed using R. Statistical analysis will show similarities and differences in genes, taxa, and abundance. Depending on the depth and coverage, it is likely that the resulting analysis will be gene-centric and not produce whole genomes in which functional genes can be mapped back to. These soil samples are highly diverse and contain an abundant number of taxa, unlike acid mine drainage communities which are simple. As a result, the more replicates and sequencing depth and coverage, the more likely that subtleties between the two communities can be elucidated. The other problem with this analysis, is that it does not give information on active gene transcription. An additional study including metatranscriptomics and even metabolomics would be adventageous, coupled with experimental analysis of particular functions (e.g. measuring methane production, etc.).",,,,,,kirkjen1@msu.edu,Good,Good,Very Good,Very Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Very Good,Very Good,,Very Well,Yes,Yes,Yes,Thank you for the wonderful experience!

To better assess differences in diversity among the different sections of the gut, the digestive system of the worm would be sectioned based on it anatomy and DNA from each section will be isolated separately. The inner lining of the sectioned digestive system will be scrapped and three subsamples of DNA extracted. Each subsample will be sequenced to have technical replicates as well as experimental replicates.    To minimize sequencing biases due to differences in DNA extraction yields, DNA will be diluted to the same molecule number. Data generated from sequencing will be analyzed in Qiime. Sequences will first be filtered using the FastX tool and a Q score of 30 will be used as a cutoff. Read normalization, using DigiNorm, will be done to remove redundant data, and to filter out low abundant kmers in high sequence coverage areas. Normalized reads will then be assembled with MegaHit, followed by sequence annotation with Prokka.    Some challenges that one would face when analyzing this type of data would be when deciding between the number of different tools Qiime offers at each step of its pipeline. For example, when determining the best OTU picking process, open vs. closed reference system, it is necessary to understand the limitations that both options have, and make a sound judgment based on what is known about they data you are working with.  Because this is not a well known study system open reference OTU selection process would most likely be the best option.      Additional resources, such as Qiime tutorials or the literature, would be needed to figure out the best options to analyze the data you have generated.",OTU profiles generated from Illumina sequencing would be analysed for with-in land use diversity and between land use diversity. To calculate comparative diversity one would have to determined if they would used a weighted or unweighted distance matrix and whether you are interested just presence/absence data or phylogeny/ taxonomy. ,,,,,,arober52@kent.edu,Good,Good,Very Good,Very Good,Adequate,Adequate,Good,Very Good,Very Good,Very Good,,Somewhat,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.838709677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
