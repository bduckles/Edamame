After receiving the sequencing data, I would QC my data to remove poor reads. At that point, I would use MothuR to to attempt to align my reads and get an idea of the community composition of my worm. However, this would be problematic because, as mentioned, there are likely many novel microorganisms present in my sample and they would likely not be present in microbial databases making alignments difficult. This paired with the short reads from Illumina sequencing would make it difficult  to get higher resolution community data from the bulk of my reads. I don't know of an easy fix for this problem, but moving towards longer read sequencing platforms such as Pacbio or Oxford Nanopore may help provide additional information. However, I think a metagenomic approach paired with some culture-based isolation and sanger sequencing may be a labor intensive, but good way to go. ","My understanding is that is difficult to get high sensitivity/specific taxonomic identifications when dealing with soil metagenomic samples because soil samples are inherently species rich and dense in terms of total bacterial population. This makes getting an appropriate sequencing depth difficult or at least expensive. This sequencing depth is going to be the main consideration that will dictate your expected sensitivity. This relationship between sequencing depth and sensitivity can be determined after data analysis using a variety of packages that perform analyses somewhat similar to a rarefaction curve.  I believe that rarefaction curves have fallen out of favor though and I'm unfamiliar with what the preferred analytical technique is.

From each worm I would extract the DNA from the whole gut (depending on the diet, this could be a challenge) by dissecting the gut in a sterile environment and send the samples to sequencing. Because contamination could be an aditional problem I would also send a wash of my dissecting tools (the ones that were supposed to be sterile) to sequence as controls. I will then sequence all my samples in the same run (to minimize variation due to the sequencing)- however one of the main challenges is that depending on the complexity of the coomunities I could get very different coverage of the whole community and it is hard to know exactly the coverage needed before knowing the diversity of the sample. Once I get the results back I would have to assemble my samples and map them to known taxa using the available data bases. Because this is a non-model worm with very speciallized diet, the OTU assignment can be a challenge and I might miss important information if I cut the OTU at the 97% identity level or lower. One could potentially just use the diversity in 16s sequences by aligning them and determining the nucleotide diversity within the sample. I will need speciallized software to assemble the 16s genes, perform the alignment and OTU assignments as well as to calculate the nucleotide diversity in my samples. For comparing the diversity across my samples I will need to account for the phyllogenetic diversity of the worms themselves, which might be hard with a non-model species. ","First of all, given that this are whole genome sequences of soil samples (with high microbial diversity and complexity) depending on my number of replicates I might want to do more than line.

Then I would assemble genes as far as possible (this is particularly hard when there are no good reference databases. Depensing on my question I might look at genes of ineterest in a partisular function or functions (e.g. antibiotic production or nitrogen fixation). However having a greater diversity of genes for that function present does not necessarilly mean that the functions are currently being carried out (genes might not be expressed and there is a probability of miss-calling genes, specially if they are pseudogenes or have recently aquired new functions. Another approach is to use whole genome metrics like G-C content and total number of genes as the fuctional traits of interest. The problem is that is not necesarily clea what function is that and it depends on a proper assignment of genes to particular genomes.

First, I would feed worms with different well-controlled diets. This should help to assess which microbiome is related to each metabolism. If it is the fist attempt with the worm, I should sterilize of the body (eliminate the outside microbiome) and cut the worm in sections in order to analyze the different gut sections by separate. By this ways, I should be able to analyze Diet x Gut section.
Analysis
The main problem I see are the databases. If the worm is non-model, it is probable that many of the reads will not be in databases. I should use a de-novo OTU picking strategy in order to avoid the need of an external database to define the OTUs. The same for taxonomy, probably too much reads will be classified as Unknown.
Once defined the OTU table, I should use some of the mutivariate analyses such as RDA or CCA to assess the influence of diet/section on the gut microbiome.
If some OTU is overrepresented in some of the experimental sets. I should look for its metabolic features in literature in order to figure out what could be it doing there.","There are a lot of ways/tools to analyze, but it depends on the scientific question. If I'm only comparing both plot types, I should use exploratory analyses such as multivariate in order to explore the data. Depending on what we see, we would be able to define the rest of the workflow.
About specificity/identification, I don't know how biased are databases towards ""korn-growing"" or ""cow pasture-manure"" soils. Maybe there are overrepresented sequences of specific metabolisms. I should construct my own database and assign my reads withe the same to avoid biases.","36","Ph.D.-holding Professional","Male","Latino(a)","Leran!","931337"
