I could also specifically sort out a certain functional group of mircorganisms (methanogens, for instance) and then compare the relative abundance of these taxa among the two fields. Technical limitations include assessing the amount of total biomass vs. species abundance (so relative abundance allows you to more easily compare the 2 fields). It would also be important to incorporate metadata into these analyses.

Once I have figured out how diverse the gut microbial community is of this worm, I would then clone these fragments into a plasmid and transform the plasmid into E. coli. I would then use a colony PCR to digest the fragements and use primers to ensure I have one distinct fragment. I would clean this PCR product up and then send off for Sanger sequencing. The main challenge I would expect to face is scale. There would be a large amount of bacterial families in the gut microbiome that this analysis would take forever (well, not literally but weeks to months). Resources I would need: Reference material to tell me what families to expect (which would guide me towards knowing which primers to use), undergrads (in order to help me with all the cloning and transformation and PCR), and 10 thermocyclers so I can streamline this process.",I have no idea. I might start in R since I have a tiny background. I would have to look up tutorials on scripts and packages to install in order to guide me in the right direction.

An additional resource includes the ribosomal database to find the identity of unknown classifications or close relatives. ","I can generate an OTU table and analyze using PERMANOVA and ordination (NMDS) analysis to determine differences in microbial community structure between the two plot types. The limitation of this analysis is that it is not replicated across other areas (only one farm). The sequencing will be very sensitive to genetic information, but not specific to taxonomic and functional sequences. It will be difficult to determine from what taxa the DNA came from in the sample, but could find functional genes that may be important in ecological functioning of the soil. Poor study for structural diversity, but good for functional diversity.",Answer,NA,,"Not sure about ""strategy""---only have experience with Illumina sequencing.

There will be difficulties understanding the mechanism because the worm is non-model. Other publicly available data could be used during analysis to compare and undersand the data. ,The data would be categorized based on treatment and analyze the alpha and beta diversity. PCoA would be useful to see if there is any difference between treatment groups. The sensitivity could go down to genus level on taxonomic identiication with Illumina. ,Answer,NA,,"My sequencing strategy would be to prep the 16S rRNA gene markers using PCR in the lab and then send them off for sanger sequencing. Then I would use the BLAST database to identify the species in the worm gut. Problems I could foresee include the inability to identify unique species when blasting against known species that may not be similar to species in this unique gut environment. I would also expect that differences in the gut microbial community may not be seen at the level of the 16S rRNA gene, if the environment only supports a small subset of microbial species. Finally, I think there could be potential contamination of the gut samples with 16S rRNA genes from worm mitochondria, if the samples were not collected properly.  ",The first step I would take would be to assess the quality of the data and use trimmomatic to clean up the sequences. Next I would run qiime to create a mapping file to run in R to create an NMDS or something of the sorts? That is all I know how to do and I cannot say much else on the matter... ,"Answer, Not sure",Disclaimer: I am not attending the workshop in full due to other commitments this week so if I am still ignorant on my post-assessment do not take it too personally!,Not attending all,"I would choose broad-spectrum 16s PCR primers, and make libraries from 16s PCR products from a large number of worms grown under similar conditions. Then I would use Roche 454 pyrosequencing to sequence the libraries. I would use the NCBI database or another database to identify the sequences I find and then compare them to public datasets of gut microbiomes of model worms in order to find similarities and differences. Alternatively, I would include gut microbiome samples from a model worm in my sequencing project in order to be able to compare them and find both the similar and unique OTUs. I expect that there will be a large number of un-identifiable OTUs as it is not a model organism and likely contains microbes that are not characterized. ","I would use the QIIME pipeline to analyze differences between microbial communities from the two plot types. First I would look at within-plot type diversity, and then compare to between-plot type diversity. Then I would look at differences in abundance and richness between the plot types in order to identify  community differences. I expect that this type of study will have relatively low sensitivity for identifying OTUs as we are sequencing total soil DNA rather than just 16s. However, this does enable us to identify community differences in functional genes, such as nutrient cycling genes; however, still with somewhat low resolution, unless a massive level of sequencing is performed.  ",Answer,"Based on this assessment I clearly have a lot to learn, and I'm excited for the opportunity!",Learn,"Upon extracting DNA from the worm, I'd perform a library prep for multiplexing the 16s amplicons on an Illumina sequencing platform such as MiSeq or HiSeq. After receiving the sequencing data, I would QC my data to remove poor reads. At that point, I would use MothuR to to attempt to align my reads and get an idea of the community composition of my worm. However, this would be problematic because, as mentioned, there are likely many novel microorganisms present in my sample and they would likely not be present in microbial databases making alignments difficult. This paired with the short reads from Illumina sequencing would make it difficult  to get higher resolution community data from the bulk of my reads. I don't know of an easy fix for this problem, but moving towards longer read sequencing platforms such as Pacbio or Oxford Nanopore may help provide additional information. However, I think a metagenomic approach paired with some culture-based isolation and sanger sequencing may be a labor intensive, but good way to go. ",My understanding is that is difficult to get high sensitivity/specific taxonomic identifications when dealing with soil metagenomic samples because soil samples are inherently species rich and dense in terms of total bacterial population. This makes getting an appropriate sequencing depth difficult or at least expensive. This sequencing depth is going to be the main consideration that will dictate your expected sensitivity. This relationship between sequencing depth and sensitivity can be determined after data analysis using a variety of packages that perform analyses somewhat similar to a rarefaction curve.  I believe that rarefaction curves have fallen out of favor though and I'm unfamiliar with what the preferred analytical technique is. I'd recommend doing a pilot sampling of both sample sites in order to determine an optimal sequencing depth before conducting the experiment. ,Answer,NA,,"do 16S rRNA sequencing (Illumina; MiSeq) of at least 30 gut microbial samples, process the data through mothur/qiime, subsample your sequences to the lowest number of sequences, figure out if you're sequencing depth was adequate (e.g. rarefaction curves plateau), analyze and visualize your data in R.  Challenges: since the worm has such specialized diet, maybe many of the OTUs will be unclassified and possibly rare. Would have to pick worms of similar size/weight, age, health status, and who have the same diet (if influence of diet is not the question you are interested in). These are all confounding variables you must try to control for during research design OR during analyses. Additional resources: I need metadata on the gut samples, sequencing software, R, Stack Overflow, and book on multivariate statistics.","I would compare the metagenomic content (gene and gene patwhays) of the microbiota between the two plot types (corn vs pasture), and also within a sample if we have other correlates we think are important. I have problems with this study because it is one farm and two plot types; how do we know these findings are not unique to this one farm? also what is the question? how corn and pasture vegetation differ in their soil microbiota? if so, there are so many other confounding variables (age of site, soil type, differential amounts of water, level of disturbance).",Answer,"I think I will learn a lot, especially about analyzing metagenomic data because I am completely new to that. Also, I know nothing about NCBI and BLAST. I expect to sharpen my knowledge on the rest of the material (sequence processing, R, unix/shell commands, running stats).","Learn, Analysis","I would sequence a few samples from the diggestive tract of that worm as well as other close relatives that do not share that rare diet. From each worm I would extract the DNA from the whole gut (depending on the diet, this could be a challenge) by dissecting the gut in a sterile environment and send the samples to sequencing. Because contamination could be an aditional problem I would also send a wash of my dissecting tools (the ones that were supposed to be sterile) to sequence as controls. I will then sequence all my samples in the same run (to minimize variation due to the sequencing)- however one of the main challenges is that depending on the complexity of the coomunities I could get very different coverage of the whole community and it is hard to know exactly the coverage needed before knowing the diversity of the sample. Once I get the results back I would have to assemble my samples and map them to known taxa using the available data bases. Because this is a non-model worm with very speciallized diet, the OTU assignment can be a challenge and I might miss important information if I cut the OTU at the 97% identity level or lower. One could potentially just use the diversity in 16s sequences by aligning them and determining the nucleotide diversity within the sample. I will need speciallized software to assemble the 16s genes, perform the alignment and OTU assignments as well as to calculate the nucleotide diversity in my samples. For comparing the diversity across my samples I will need to account for the phyllogenetic diversity of the worms themselves, which might be hard with a non-model species. ","First of all, given that this are whole genome sequences of soil samples (with high microbial diversity and complexity) depending on my number of replicates I might want to do more than line. I would want to do the sequencing by blocking my replicates, so that no treatment is overrepresented in a particular line of illumina. Then I would assemble genes as far as possible (this is particularly hard when there are no good reference databases. Depensing on my question I might look at genes of ineterest in a partisular function or functions (e.g. antibiotic production or nitrogen fixation). However having a greater diversity of genes for that function present does not necessarilly mean that the functions are currently being carried out (genes might not be expressed and there is a probability of miss-calling genes, specially if they are pseudogenes or have recently aquired new functions. Another approach is to use whole genome metrics like G-C content and total number of genes as the fuctional traits of interest. The problem is that is not necesarily clea what function is that and it depends on a proper assignment of genes to particular genomes.

I would then use NMDS to look for general differences between the two plot types and see whether the variation within a plot is distinct from the variation between the plots.  If there do appear to be major differences, I would then look at the dominant families within the two plots and see whether they show specific life history strategies associated with the two environments (for example, if the dairy cow pasture had more methanogens or organisms capable of tolerating high nitrogen concentrations).  I would then look at patterns in the life histories of the dominant taxa in each group to understand what is driving the difference.Since I'm sequencing total DNA from soils, I would expect to find diverse taxa (many that were previously unidentified) so I would expect most of my reads to be identified to species.",Answer,NA,,I would use general 16S primers to get a feel for the general population of the microbes in this gut.I might consult the literature to find if there is a group of bacteria that was driving variation in this gut and see if I could use/develop primers to get at this community of microbes...I would be concerned that relative proportions of bacterial groups was not properly represented and I would note that 16S wouldn¾ét provide any information about the function of these microbes. ,"I don¾ét know if I¾ém interpreting the question properly, but I think we are assuming the sequences are evenly distributed among the sample...I don¾ét really know how to assess the sensitivity or specificity of these things, but I assume I¾éve run some sort of mock community with my samples and maybe can use this to get at specificity.
