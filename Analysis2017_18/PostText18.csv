A lack of a reference database could be challenging, but I think a mock community could be used as a positive control. ",I am still a little confused about this. Sorry!,Not sure,I was able to attend this workshop because I received a fee waiver for room and board. Thank you! This workshop has provided me with a lot of skills I didn't even know I needed for my dissertation work. Thank you so muchNA,NA,None,NANA,NA,None,NANA,NA,None,NAIt might be difficult to obtain enough sequences from the gut of the worm- you may need to increase sequencing depth of the the 16s rRNA gene. Challenges include low sequence numbers and limited annotation in databases. You made to change your strategy for picking otus- to a denovo approach. ,Assuming you have similar sampling effort at each plot type and your data fits and your data meets the assumption of an underlying statistical distribution you could perform a PERMANOVA to look at treatment effects or use a non-parametric approach or a non-parametric approach like ANOSIM,Answer,THIS WAS AWESOME- in all respects!"I would collect either stool samples or gut samples and send the DNA for 16s sequencing using illumina platform. Choosing which region of the 16s to target would be a challenge, however resources are available to help decide which region to targeting depending on the objective. I would use the community data to predict what percentage of the community is involved in the breakdown of the specific compounds in the data. There are available github repositories with computational workflows which i can follow to guide me in the analysis and answer the specific questions related to my research.","i would use statistical analyses to analyze the alpha and beta diversity of the two plots differently. I will look for changes in the community dynamic between the two plots as they would probably translate to different functions. I will try network analyses to see how microbial groups are connected to each other and how different they are connected between the two communities.Challenges will be to determine how many samples will be enough to sequence deep enough. ",Answer,NAPlanning of the experiment to overcome the challenges inherent in the microbial community structure and sampling effor; get high quality data through amplicon sequencing; analyze the data properly in R/Python. ,"I would use different metrics (alpha/beta diversity; PERMANOVA, etc) to identify and model the relationships between the microbial community and environmental variables that could be potential drivers of the system; I'd also would be interested in knowing the functions/activities that those communities could be performing. The technical limitation may be the number of plots located on a single farm that could not be representative of the soil of the region I'm studying; this could be a big limitation and drawing conclusions with regard to the entire microbial structure of that particular region would be misleading.",Answer,The WS was awesome! The instructors and TAs were amazing at teaching! This WS will certainly take my career to a higher level of expertise in the field."I would isolate samples from the gut of this worm, as well as from the gut of reference samples. I would also be be sure to collect worms from various locations to ensure there was not sampling biases. I would also make sure to do my isolations and sequencing in duplicate. Some challenges I would face would be is to get full enough coverage in the metagenome from sequencing. Additional recourse that could be useful would be reference metagenomes from other worm species.","I would conduct both 16s rRNA gene sequencing and shot-gun sequencing, and compare the results. 16s rRNA sequencing would let me who's there, and shot-gun would give me more detail, such as the variation between strains, total genetic capacity. I would use PCoA to compare the 16s data after sample processing and normalization. With the shot gun data I would assemble it, annotate it, then PCoA. I would be limited by knowing who's active. If I wanted to know this I would so transcriptomics.",Answer,"This course has been the best use of my time. I feel so much more confident in my data analysis skills and have gotten so much out of the experience. I am sad that the course is over, and would like there to be an EDAMAME partII. I honestly cannot say enough positive things about this experience, I feel that this was the catalyst to really allow me to excel in my research.""I would look at the quality of the raw data using a tool like fastx, then would remove the adapters, and demultiplex the sequences by sample, I could then trim the sequences to get high quality reads, possibly to 251bp for 16S. I would again look at the quality of the sequences. I would make contigs, and then I would use the trim the sequences and remove sequences with long homopolymers. I would remove chimeras using vsearch or something similar. I would then cluster the sequences and run them against a reference database like RDP, but also could use a more worm-specific database if it exists. For this low complexity system mothur would be fine for this workflow management.",I would try to think about how many samples I could sequence from each treatment type and depth and coverage I could get out of those sequences. I am still a little less familiar with how I would go about performing the computing for this type of microbial bioinformatics method. But I do feel more comfortable thinking about the steps I would go through to think about experimental design.,Answer,"I would recommend removing a bit more of the R introduction work. At this point I feel like it is becoming more and more of a requirement in most ecology PhD programs to at least be comfortable getting data into R. This would allow more time maybe for some of the newer methods in Microbial Ecology that are coming online, and building more basic computing skills. Along those lines, including the community analyses in the mothur day was too much, most of us would do this in R anyways.It was very helpful when the TAs followed the tutorials most closely, and it was generally harder when the TAs did not follow the tutorial. It was also nice when the TAs would take the time to explain the specific arguments or flags for functions on the command line.It would be nice also to just have a basic workshop or office hours in the future about just how to load different tools into the EC2 or remote environment. It was mentioned this can be a big part of the time consumption in a lot of these more complex workflows.""Amplicon to estimate the abundance and shotgun metagenomic to confirm function. Use MOTHUR for amplicon sequencing analysis and use EC2 and metagenomic pipeline for data analysis. R can also be used for plotting results. Challenges are that molecular sequencing tools will provide some information to understand the basics and may not guide the understanding of the genes  related to the breakdown of the special diet. If these genes are identified, they could be qPCR quantified for confirmation. ",Running all the data together through the pipeline in order to apply similar quality treatment to the data set to allow downstream analysis. Functional sequencing identification will be limited by the database used for data annotations and could miss some of the functions. Comparative statistics such as ANOSIM and Unifrac (if 16rRNA is used) or comparison of contigs and annotation tables,Answer,Please keep teaching and providing the workshop. It is very useful and helpfule I would choose for a deeper sequencing coverage that would allow for longer reads. I would expect to have difficulties when trying to annotate the OTUs using a reference database since the study community is unique and not belonging from a model-worm. ,"First I would clean the data to remove contamination and sequencing errors.If I wanted to investigate how specific functions are distributed in the different soil types, I would use the metagenomic data from each soil to look for specific genes. For that I would assemble the genomes into contigs and then do a blast using public database information on the sequence of the genes of interest. I could also use the genome to determine all the functions present by running a function annotation using a database. Similarly, I could perform taxonomic annotation using the 16S rRNA gene in the same metagenomic dataset.",Anser,NA"challenges: non-model could introduce variables to the analysis (different worms may have unique starting gut microbiome or depends upon the environment; genes for breaking down the ""special diet"" between non-model worms may be slightly different.  Strategy: Sample multiple worms from several different environments (maybe use as a condition); also obtain data for other worm that doesn't breakdown the diet for comparison;...","analyze: corn vs non-corn; samples of manure from cows to determine impact of this on the soil micro; sample pasture with ""little"" impact by cows; tech limits: being able to annotate properly or combining databases to analyze/annotate entire environ (soil: microbes, fungi, plants/eukaryotes, manure: cow, plants, microbes, fungi)",Answer,NANA,NA,None,NA"Using v4 primers, I would get amplicon sequences and use the mothur pipeline to quality control and build contigs from the F and R reads, then use the de novo clustering methods in mothur to define OTUs at the 97% level. I would also use mothur to annotate against the SILVA databases. After the workshop, I still expect to face some challenges but many fewer. For example, I am not 100% sure how to build my own EC2 instance, but I feel comfortable enough that I can figure it out. I also am sure there will be some challenges along the pipeline with errors in executing commands, etc, but I feel comfortable enough to troubleshoot those. In terms of additional resources, I feel comfortable that I have access to everything (EC2, mothur, R). The only additional resources I would seek may be advice from other scientists.","Using the raw reads from each site, I would use an EC2 instance to download the several packages we learned about (such as Trimmomatic, etc) and begin by trimming the raw reads to remove both the adaptors and low quality reads. Then I would assemble the trimmed reads (both F and R) into contigs using megahit. Then I would map the raw reads to the contigs to make hit counts using bowtie2.  After this, there are two options, depdending on if I were interested in reconstructing large contigs or if I were more interested in total hits to particular genes. I usually am interested in the latter. Therefore, I would use gene calling to get hits to particular ORFs. I would do this with HTSeq by comparing to MGRAST for the gene annotation ORFs.I understand now the limitations of this analysis. The ability to reconstruct a metagenome greatly depends on the sequencing depth and diversity of the sample. While MiSeq can be used to detect 10s of 1000s of OTUs, due to the greater size of a genome compared to the 16S gene, you can really only cover a limited subset of genome-equivalents. This gets even harder if the community is very diverse, as the coverage per genome will be reduced. I feel comfortable making these calculations for a particular environment based on the sequencing depth (HiSeq is probably better) and the expected diversity of the community.",Answer,Thank you! It was great!"First, I would decide what region to sequence: probably want to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Then I would decide what platforms to use for analysis of the raw sequence data. I would keep A copy of the raw data fastq file would be used for multiple platforms: I would use mothur as one platform to assemble OTUs, and then also use QIIME as another platform to assemble OTUs. Some issues to consider with these two platforms is that OTU clustering is based on 97% similarity, so it's possible that actually different organisms could OTUs be clustered together. To mediate this some, I would also use the Usearch pipeline and ZOTUs to create amplicon sequence variants that are based off of 100% similarity. I would then compare the two OTU assemblies and the ASV and look for discrepancies between the two outputs. ","One approach to understand how the functional gene potential varies between the two farm soils is to assemble and annotate the metagenomes using BLAST, and another approach for metaG assembly and annotation would be to use MG-RAST. Issues to troubleshoot on both of these platforms is to make sure the adapters were accurately trimmed. It's possible that one of the paired ends may be lost during trimming of the adapters. Also need to make sure the quality score for the alignment is good.",Answer,"I LOVED this workshop! I came in vaguely knowing the language of microbial bioinformatics, but not knowing how all of these platforms and analysis fits together. I now feel like I know the language adequately and can have a sustained conversation about sequencing methods and amplicon and metagenome assembly. I also feel like I can start working with my own sequence data, and when I come to a problem I know what questions to ask to troubleshoot it. I also loved the diversity of speakers and backgrounds of the TAs. It really gave me a broad perspective of how these bioinformatics tools are being used. Thank you so much for this workshop!! I learned so much here, even beyond bioinformatics and analysis.""we can use any high throughput sequencing, but I thing Ilumina sequencing is the most common platform. The problem is, you maybe get a lot of eukaryotic DNA contamination. Thus, you might have to use more specific marker/primer. Second problem that you might be faced is the limitation of references resulted in low resolution of the taxonomy of your data. To explore the data set, you need to understand what is the questions or purposes of your experiment. Thus, you may have to try different set of statistical approaches on R. Besides, you may also try to build your own references/databases of gut microbial community with   other researchers from the same field in order to get better/higher resolution of your taxonomic analysis.","the experiment is very interesting because you have two very different two sites. Taxonomic and functional analyses can be done by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA sequencing. But, since 16S rRNA gene is too conserved sometimes it makes difficult to distinguish the communities, thus you may want to use rplB gene or other specific gene. You might want to see the differences between those sites by comparing the alpha and beta diversity of the two data. Then you will want to know who are the big players of the communities there by analyzing the most abundant taxa. It is also important to determine the core microbiome between those two sites because since the samples come from single farm, you might want to see shared microbial taxa.",Answer,I think it is important for the instructor to follow the tutorial otherwise we will get confuse. Also I think it would be good if the course covers not only mother but also other popular pipelines such as QIIME2 and I really want to learn DADA2 as well. "I would aim to target for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA, as it is least prone to errors. I would expect the diversity to be lower compared to soil environments for example, so we could expect a higher coverage for each representative. It will largely depend on the research questions, but guts are quite stable environments. If you want to find changes in community composition one needs to design experiments including stressors or different diets. If the question is the function of the microbial community in the digestion of the specialised diet, 16S rRNA probably will not give much of a better insight. Another issue could be, as the system you study is very specific that the annotation of taxa and their classification might be difficult as databases may lack those taxa. Again, it will depend on your research question but combining 16S rRNA with metagenomics or transcriptomics could be more insightful for their functions.","A general issue of soil samples will be that diversity is so high that you might end up with a very low coverage of reads. Meaning that one potentially will only be able to sequence the most abundant representatives in both plot types. If the research question is to see community composition differences, total DNA (metagenomics) will reduce the amount of information but 16S rRNA would be a better approach. If the aim is also to investigate the functional potential, the approach to increase specificity is to do an assembly based annotation. It will allow you to assemble longer contigs on which you can map the reads. One has to be aware though that you will loose a lot of information and probably will only be able to investigate the most abundant organisms in both soil types. On the other hand, if one is interested in the number of functions one should do a raw read based annotation with the mind-set that one can have mis-annotations due to too short reads.",Answer,"I really enjoyed the office hours where we could discuss about specific approaches. I wish I would have been further in my project to have more specific questions to discuss but it was already very insightful to hear about other peoples problems and research questions. I also liked that you invited speakers to talk about their research so we can see the approaches being applied. But I think it would have been helpful if you could have added examples of experimental or field studies in the presentations before we start learning about the workflow. We had several questions about when to use what approach and then often the answer was ""it will depend on your questions, what is your question?"". But I think you could give a broad overview of what kind of questions you can ask by using which method. We covered this by talking about everyone's specific problems but I have the impression that the answer was less clear than it could have been.Something else that came into my mind was, when we talked about how people were selected to come to the workshop. I had the impression that people who already have a dataset were preferred over people without one. However, I think this workshop is also very helpful for students in their early stages, too, to prevent all the potential sequencing mistakes that one can fall into to maximise their data quality because that's what enables us to do a better or more confident data analysis.Otherwise, even if the course was very intensive and exhausting, I learned a lot and more than I expected. I was amazed by the TAs support and the generous financial support we got to cover the accomodation and food. Thank you!""I would extract mgDNA from the digestive tract of the non-model worm,  separating out the gut sections if appropriate. I would do the same with either a related model worm as a control/comparison, or would look for a closely related worm that does have this specific diet. I would prepare multiple replicates, expecting subtle differences in data. I would quality asses, normalize, and trim the sequence data, then cluster the reads into OTUs using mothur. A non model worm with a unique digestive tract and diet may harbor microbes that are not well represented in databases of known or cultured organisms, so I would likely have to cluster the sequences de novo before identifying them taxonomically. I would use R to calculate the similarity matrix to compare the communities of the different worms . I would then create an ordination and do some hypothesis testing to determine whether the communities are different (either between worms or within worms eating a different diet) ","Soil is highly diverse and contains many microbial taxa, so I would sequence as deeply as possible, while using multiple replicate extractions from each site.  I would start analysis by QC-ing the data, then assemble the sequences into contigs. I would begin analysis by looking at community membership - either by 16S or functional gene sequences to get an idea of whether membership changes by site, but this analysis is limited due to the conserved nature of the 16S gene. I would start by looking for functional genes that show significant changes in abundance between sites, along with looking for correlating changes in metadata (soil chemistry, features, etc). I would use that information to generate hypotheses on which functions or microbes may be important in processes important to each site. ",Answer,"Some modules did a great job on explaining the decision process behind the software choice/settings/etc. which makes the knowledge much more transferrable to our own work. Others were more rote copy/paste tutorials and did not discuss *why* we would choose a particular st of parameters or packages, or what  is the goal, function, or output of a given set of commands. I found this to be the case for the mothur tutorial in particular, and to some degree also with the metagenome analysis tutorials. I would have appreciated more discussion on how to adapt these workflows to different questions or datasets, with some specific examples.The manual ordination exercise was really helpful in emphasizing the process behind the calculations. ""I would want to blast against a large and well curated reference database, probably NCBI or RDP. However, since this worm has a unique digestive tract and specialized diet, it is likely that the organisms in it's gut are not well characterized. In this case, I think it would be particularly useful to consider the diet of the organisms specifically (i.e. what microbes may be entering its gut), the specific conditions of the gut (e.g. pH), and the community from a better characterized/model worm.","I'd want to have high replication of field samples from each plot type for 16S amplicon sequencing that are spatially dispersed within the site in order to capture as much of the heterogeneity within the plot as possible. I would also want to sample for metagenomes, but because of amount of data, I would need to limit these samples to perhaps 2 per plot type. Together, these two datasets would allow me to explore ""dominant"" community structure (16S) and examine a more less biased, more functionally informative set of data (metagenomes). The 16S samples will provide a phylogenetically coarser view, but spatially resolved view of the site, while the metagenomes will provide a higher resolution view of potential differences in community composition and function between the two sites. ",Answer,"Being new to genomics and bioinformatics, I would have appreciated some more discussion on what exactly we were analyzing at each step of the process. Though still an incredibly useful course, I feel that I left with a strong understanding of how to use my computer to organize and analyze my data, but less of an understanding for why I would choose to do it that way or what I was actually doing to my data at each step of the process.""I feel more comfortable with the tools necessary to do this, but still feel uncomfortable knowing where to start and sequential steps of doing so. However, if someone helped specify steps for me, I feel confident in my ability to start each step. ","I feel more comfortable with the tools necessary to do this, but still feel uncomfortable knowing where to start and sequential steps of doing so.

",Answer,"It would've been nice to have the TAs each introduce themselves the same way the students did with lightning presentations and having them at the start of the day rather than the end. It'd also be helpful to have a pdf with each students' name, photo, location and short summary on their research sent out before the conference in order to get to know everyone a little better before the workshop and think of potential collaborations. I also would have liked some sort of ice breaker involving having people split into groups based on comfort with computing, area of research (soil, human gut, water, etc.) to encourage discussion and further collaboration."NA,NA,None,"I was expecting to use my data at the workshop. Like in office hours, which I really appreciated. Something like: Day 1: all the eramame-rs who has brough their own data and want o work on it should come to the office hour to hold a ""pre analysis"" of the data with the TA's. Talk a little bit about the projects, questions and hipotesis of the study. I known that this can be challenging, but in my point of view it would be like perfect. Those who doesn't have their own data could get some from the TAs (as a small sub project) and follow up in the course with these. So, for every tool learned the instructor may present it wth their own data, but use it with each ones data. Like since the begining... ""The day my data arrived"".Another idea. Once I read a paper about endphytic bacterial diversity in the rainforest, where all the data was collected and partially analysed by studands of a summer discipline. Professors and students published the article together.One very important point for me that helps a lot in undertanding and using with confidence all the tools presented, is to get familiar, get involved and know about the data, then being much more curious about the result. Like ""fighting"" for it.Anyway, just an idea.CONGRATULATIONS TO ASHLEY, ADINA AND ALL THE TA'S. Even though I'm not confortable with all the tools, after the course I feel I CAN DO IT! Many thanks for the opportinity."
