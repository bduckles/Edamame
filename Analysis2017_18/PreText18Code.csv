The most difficult part would be training the classifier. Additional resources would include running this analysis in a computer cluster.","I would use a simple Wilcox test to differentiate the abundances of the microbes between the  two types of pastures. For such an analysis, I would implement log ratio transformations before performing the statistical test to increase the power of my analysis, as the microbiome data seems to be sitting in a different structure (simplex space) compared to other types of data. However, this analysis would be very limited as the sites seem to be close to each other and taken from the same farm. I wouldn't analyze this data in terms of functions as the sequencing was performed on the DNA level, rather than on the RNA level.",Answer,I have a high expectation on this workshop and I'm tremendously motivated to take part of it. ,High expect"I would 16s gene sequence multiple samples from multiple worms to try to capture the variance within the microbiomes of that species. A challenge would be to make sure to collect enough samples from enough worms to capture the full gambit of diversity. Additional resource that would be useful is the gut microbiome of other worms, this would allow you to see how this worm's microbiome is unique.","I would assemble the metagenomes, then look at the diversity within them, comparing them with a multidimensional analysis. Technical limits could depend on the depth of coverage and that amount of samples sequenced.",Answer,Im really excited to learn from the experts. I hope this course is accessible for all levels of computing knowledge.,Hope"Start by baselining the microbial community of the entirety of the worm's tract, compared to each component that is involved in different parts of diet breakdown. Richness and diversity might not be informative enough and you might need functional information that would help to explain what is going on with these communities. Using Picrust on the 16S data or eventually moving on to meta genome work could help with that.  If this is such a unique and specialized tract, issues might arise in identification of specific bacterial species (as many might not be identified to species names due to limitations in the database).","Start by exploring alpha and beta diversity. This could help to determine if there are significant diversity differences. I would also examine the actual taxonomic composition, using barplots. LDA to determine if certain taxa are found more so in one plot than another. ",Answer,I'm hoping to gain a better understanding and skill set in analyzing 16s and shotgun data.

Challenges would be in separating microbial DNA/sequences from that of the host. I also expect challenges in data processing and analysis, as these technologies are new to me. ","I would look at functional genes and pathways, as well as presence/absence of certain microbes to see how these two communities compare in response to their environment. I would use contextual data from each site to inform these differences, looking at changes in community along with environmental differences.

I would expect that the corn site would favor microbes that can promote plant growth (eg nitrogen fixers) and that don't require a lot of nutrients, because the corn will hog them.  While the pasture would receive a lot of amendments of  nutrients and eukaryotic microbes from the cow that have really nothing to do with a ""typical' soil, and that may promote the growth of certain soil microbes that otherwise would not be fit to do so.  Also, depth at which the microbiome is sampled would play an important roll (surface of pasture would receive most added nutrients).",Answer,NA,NA"A strategy might be to begin sequencing with at least 5 samples from what is considered your control worm to better understand what you are dealing with before you begin a large scale analysis. If you can extract the gut microbial community in a sterile way and extract the DNA you could sequence it on an illumina miseq. Because this worm is non-model and the digestive tract is unique there may not be a lot of hits in any database but it'll be good to know that first. You could have the data run through QIIME to get a scope of the community but keep an eye on the amount of unidentified sequences. You will of course be limited on how you can solve these by the database but you could also try pulling data from NCBI to compare, specifically gut microbiomes found in other worms to start and you may be able to find an analogue. ","I would likely, because it is currently all I know how to do, use DIAMOND with the NR database to identify the sequences to taxonomy using a high e-value (.00001) to improve sensitivity and specificity and also ascertain the function then run them through MEGAN6 to get the counts to identity to sample profile. I would then match up all this data to the metadata. Using that I would begin to run a PCoA between the samples to see if they actually cluster differently. Supposing that they do I would then perform an ANOVA to understand which of the community members is causing this difference. I would also pull out the community members that are found in both sample sets using the core microbiome subscript in MEGAN. Function I am unfortunately less sure about. There are a few limitations one of course being that without a control plot it would be difficult to say what is just the native community and what is caused by the corn or the cows. On the more technical side depending on how many samples you have and the complexity of the community it may be hard to find the principle community for each plot.",Answer,To be dramatic I hope to have the veil of uncertainty about the analysed I should have been doing and limitations of my data I should have known about be lifted. and of course network with some other super cool scientists!,Learn"I am not exactly sure what a 'sequencing strategy' means - a strategy to pick samples and subsamples to maximize the amount of sequencing error correction and between-sample diversity? Is this from a single worm? Are we sampling along its length? or does sequencing strategy mean what kind of platform, etc?I guess, sampling from a living organism (and a small one at that) there would be a big problem with cross-contamination, mitochondrial 16S sequences, etc. There might be a problem with the worms being stressed, or being fed food that is not their special diet, or being kept in differing environmental conditions that might influence their microbiome. There is also worm growth stage maybe (man, I don't know anything about worms). We would want to get gut samples from as many different worms as possible who are eating the specialized diet, maybe also using different conditions for some of the worms such as different temperatures, moisture levels, etc. to help find out what the core components of the gut microbiome are for this special diet and which are subject to change with the special diet. ","A huge technical limitation right off the bat is that the n for each sample is 1. We are basically comparing one sample to another sample; we just have a lot of subsamples to confirm within-sample diversity. This means that we can't make any real statements about the effects of corn plants vs pasture, because there might be something particular to this corn field or dairy farm responsible for any differences between them other than what they've been used for lately. For example, maybe the pasture is pasture because the soil has been historically poorer on that side of the farm.I would expect a very very large number of functional genes and a large amount of diversity in general even for single sub-samples. And since it is soil, there is probably a large amount of extra-cellular DNA around and a bunch of bacteria/fungi that are dormant/pores. I am not sure of the steps to figure out which functional genes are there (metagenomic binning?) but I might start with some tests looking at between-site and among-site diversity, and looking at taxa and genes most responsible for the differences between the sites using the DESeq2 package in R. If there were nutrient data for the soil I would also try linking that to functional genes.",Answer,NA,NA"Amplicon sequence v3-v4 legions of 16S rRNA of the worm digestive tract, download other worm digestive system database and those of the worm of interest, analyze your amplicon sequences and create an OTU table, mapp all the sequences together and create a phylogenetic tree showing how the gene marker of the worm and related sequences group together, compared to the rest of the sequence of other worms downloaded from the database.

The analysis will be particularly focused on these groups and depend on soil/pasture of sampled sites.  ",Answer,NA,NAthe sequencing can be conducted using ilumina sequencing or any high through put sequencing analysis after the 16S rRNA extraction. The issue that might  happens is contamination of eukaryotes. The effort that can be done is the primer design must be as specific as possible to detect microbial community in worm gut. The additional resources that might be beneficial are the microbial (bacterial and fungal) references in the databases. It is important if some scientist who work with gut microbiota construct their own databases/references so that the taxonomy assigning of the microbial community of worm's gut can be conducted with high resolution.,"The raw sequences can be analyzed using QIIME pipeline. Taxonomy assigning can be done using SILVA databases or UNITE for the fungi with threshold of 97% similarity. But because of the limitation of the microbial references, sometimes it can be difficult to get high resolution of the taxonomy. The data analyses can be conducted to analyze the beta diversity of the two sites to compare the microbial communities dispersion/patterns between the two. because the sample are taken from the single farm, the analysis of core, rare, and shared taxa can be conducted because the two sites might share the taxa.

I would compare community composition from samples from worm as well at least one ""control"" model worm by using multivariate statistics. I would try CA as a first approach. However, if the first axes do not explain enough variance, I would try NMDS. My goal would be to determine if the community is significantly different than that of worms with different diets.

However, I do not have a clue about what the sensitivity of the analysis could be and if it's enough to compare the two sites.
